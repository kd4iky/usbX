### Set Up Development Environment

This step is already quite detailed for getting started on a Linux system, but it can be expanded slightly for better completeness, including handling additional tools like Git, verifying installations, supporting more distributions, and incorporating the header-only library uthash (mentioned in later steps for state management). Here's the expanded version:

- **Choose and Prepare Your Linux System**:
  - Ensure you are working on a Linux distribution where libusb operates in userspace, such as Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, or Arch Linux. For example, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later is recommended for stability and package availability. If you're on a different OS (e.g., macOS or Windows), consider using a virtual machine with Linux (e.g., via VirtualBox or VMware) or a container like Docker, but note that USB passthrough may require additional configuration.

- **Install Required Dependencies via Package Manager**:
  - Update your package index first to ensure you get the latest versions.
  - On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems: Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt install libusb-1.0-0-dev libmicrohttpd-dev libjson-c-dev`.
  - On Fedora/RHEL-based systems: Run `sudo dnf update && sudo dnf install libusb1-devel libmicrohttpd-devel json-c-devel` (note: libusb is often named libusb1-devel on Fedora).
  - On Arch Linux: Run `sudo pacman -Syu libusb libmicrohttpd json-c`.
  - These packages provide:
    - `libusb-1.0-0-dev`: For USB device handling and communication.
    - `libmicrohttpd-dev`: For embedding a lightweight HTTP server.
    - `libjson-c-dev`: For JSON parsing and generation in C.
  - If packages are not found, check your repositories (e.g., enable universe/multiverse on Ubuntu) or search for equivalents (e.g., `apt search libusb`).

- **Install Build Tools and Git if Needed**:
  - Install essential build tools: On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install gcc make pkg-config`. On Fedora: `sudo dnf install gcc make pkgconf`. On Arch: `sudo pacman -S base-devel`.
  - Install Git for version control and cloning: On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install git`. On Fedora: `sudo dnf install git`. This is crucial for creating and managing the GitHub repository.
  - Verify installations: Run `gcc --version`, `make --version`, `pkg-config --version`, and `git --version` to confirm they are installed correctly.

- **Download Uthash for Hash Map Support**:
  - The project uses uthash, a header-only C library for hash tables (no installation required, just include the header).
  - Download `uthash.h` from the official repository: Use `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/troydhanson/uthash/master/src/uthash.h` or visit the GitHub page to download it manually. Place it in your project's `src/` directory (you'll create this in the next step).

- **Create and Clone the GitHub Repository**:
  - Log in to GitHub (github.com) and create a new repository named "usbX". Make it public or private as preferred, and optionally add a README.md file during creation with a basic description.
  - Clone it locally: Replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username and run `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/usbX.git`.
  - Navigate into the directory: `cd usbX`.
  - If you haven't configured Git yet, set up your user details: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`.

- **Optional Verification and Troubleshooting**:
  - Check library versions: Run `pkg-config --modversion libusb-1.0` (should be 1.0 or higher), `pkg-config --modversion libmicrohttpd` (ideally 0.9+), and `pkg-config --modversion json-c` (0.13+ recommended).
  - If you encounter permission issues with packages, ensure you're using sudo correctly or check your user privileges.
  - For USB development, ensure your user has access to USB devices later (e.g., add to the `plugdev` group with `sudo usermod -aG plugdev $USER` and log out/in), but this can wait until testing.

This expanded setup ensures a smooth start, covering potential gaps like uthash and verifications, without overcomplicating the basics. If you're on a non-standard distro or encounter errors, provide more details for further tailoring.
