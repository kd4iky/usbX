# TDD Test for HandleEntry Struct and Globals - Red Phase
# 
# This test verifies the smallest testable unit: that main.c can compile
# with HandleEntry struct definition and required globals without errors.
#
# Test Requirements:
# - HandleEntry struct for uthash-based USB handle management
# - Global hash map (handles)
# - Global mutex (handles_mutex)
# - Global ID counter (next_handle_id)
# - Necessary includes (uthash.h, pthread.h)
