# Code of Conduct

## Welcome!

We want this project to be a safe, friendly, and fun space for everyone.  
Whether you’re here to report a bug, suggest a feature, write code, or just learn, you’re part of the community — and we’re glad to have you here!

## Be Excellent to Each Other

Here’s what helps keep our community positive and welcoming:

- Be kind, respectful, and supportive.  
- Celebrate different ideas, perspectives, and backgrounds.  
- Give constructive feedback and be open to receiving it.  
- Help others when you can — we all start somewhere!  
- Assume good intentions and keep discussions healthy.  

## What’s Not Okay

To keep this space safe for everyone, we ask that you avoid:

- Harassment, bullying, or personal attacks.  
- Disrespectful or discriminatory language or behavior.  
- Sharing others’ private information without permission.  
- Being disruptive, overly negative, or intentionally unkind.  

Basically: treat others the way you’d like to be treated.

## Who Makes Sure This Works?

Project maintainers help make sure these guidelines are followed.  
If someone’s behavior is making you uncomfortable or crossing the line, please reach out to us at:

**[INSERT CONTACT EMAIL OR METHOD HERE]**

We’ll handle it respectfully, fairly, and as privately as possible.

## Where This Applies

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces — issues, pull requests, discussions, chat, or community events.  
It also applies when representing the project in public spaces (online or offline).

## A Gentle Reminder

We’re all human, and we all make mistakes.  
If you slip up, own it, apologize, and learn from it. That’s how we grow — together.

## Thanks  

Thank you for helping make this community a positive, welcoming place for everyone!
